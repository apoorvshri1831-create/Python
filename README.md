# Python Projects ‚Äì Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, and Statistical Forecasting

This repository contains a collection of Python-based projects focused on data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and forecasting using statistical and probability-driven approaches. These projects demonstrate the application of core data science techniques and statistical methods to derive insights, test assumptions, and make future predictions from data.

## üîç Key Components

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Feature exploration and visualization
  - Outlier detection and handling
  - Trend and pattern identification

- **Hypothesis Testing:**
  - Formulation of null and alternative hypotheses
  - Application of statistical tests (t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA, etc.)
  - Interpretation of p-values and confidence intervals

- **Predictive Analytics Using Probability:**
  - Probabilistic modeling techniques
  - Predictive analysis based on statistical distributions
  - Estimation and confidence-based forecasting

## üõ† Technologies & Tools

- Python (NumPy, pandas, SciPy, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Statistical and machine learning libraries

## üìÅ Structure

- `eda/` ‚Äì Notebooks and scripts for exploratory data analysis
- `hypothesis_testing/` ‚Äì Statistical tests and experiment validations
- `forecasting/` ‚Äì Projects focused on probability and statistical predictions
- `datasets/` ‚Äì Sample datasets used in the projects

## üìå Objective

The goal of this repository is to showcase practical implementations of fundamental data analysis and statistical techniques, useful for data-driven decision making and research-oriented projects.
